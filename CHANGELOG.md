## [1.1.0] — 2026-03-09

### Changed
- Agent system upgraded from 12-agent flat team to 3-layer CEO → Team Leads → Workers architecture
- CEO replaces Iris as entry point for all tasks
- 9 named Team Leads replace individual named agents (iris→ceo, atlas→build-lead, etc.)
- 9 Worker agents + 12 GSD execution agents replace old gsa-* execution agents
- Slash commands expanded: added `/build`, `/fix`, `/design`, `/review`
- README, QUICK_REFERENCE, GETTING_STARTED updated to reflect new architecture
- package.json version bumped to 1.1.0, repository URL fixed, Cursor removed from keywords

### Removed
- `.cursor/rules/` folder — Cursor integration removed; Claude Code + Antigravity are primary tools
- `.vscode/settings.json` — not needed for public kit
- `all_skills_stored/` excluded via .gitignore (55MB stale backup; live skills remain at `.agent/skills/`)

### Fixed
- package.json repository URL (was `YOUR_ORG` placeholder, now points to correct repo)
- Old agent name references (Iris, Atlas, Morgan, etc.) across all public docs
